		Cooking or cookery is the art of preparing food for consumption with the use of 
		heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting 
		unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The way that 
		cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual 
		cook has. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence 
		of heat, most notably with Ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish 
		is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice. Sushi also uses a similar 
		chemical reaction between fish and the acidic content of rice glazed with vinegar.

		Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans, and some 
		scientists believe the advent of cooking played an important role in human 
		evolution. Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 
		250,000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade and 
		transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new 
		ingredients.

		<h5>Directions: </h5>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Mix together the dry dough ingredients. Stir in the milk, water, and 
				butter. Kneed by hand or in stand mixer until dough is smooth and slightly 
				sticky. </li>
				<li>Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise in a 
				warm place until doubled, about an hour.</li>
				<li>Gently deflate the dough and divide into 8-10 pieces. Form each piece 
				into a ball and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Left rise 15 
				minutes.</li>
				<li> While the dough is rising, preheat oven to 400 F. In a large pot, 
				bring the water bath ingredients to a boil.</li>
				<li>Once the dough has risen, place 4 or 5 of the dough balls into the 
				boiling water bath. Boil 30 seconds on one side, then flip and boil for 30 
				seconds on the other. Remove the dough balls from the bath back to the 
				baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
				<li>Use a sharp knife or razor blade to make slashes 1/2 inch deep in the 
				top of the buns. Sprinkle with coarse salt.</li>
				<li>Bake the buns for 20-24 minutes until dark brown.</li>
