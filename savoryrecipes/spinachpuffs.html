		Cooking or cookery is the art of preparing food for consumption with the use of 
		heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting 
		unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The way that 
		cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual 
		cook has. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence 	
		of heat, most notably with Ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish 
		is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice. Sushi also uses a similar 
		chemical reaction between fish and the acidic content of rice glazed with vinegar.
		</p>

		Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans, and some 
		scientists believe the advent of cooking played an important role in human 
		evolution. Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 
		250,000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade and 
		transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new 
		ingredients.

		<h4>Spinach Puffs:</h4>
		
		<div class="ingredients">
		
		<h5>Ingredients: </h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>10 oz. package chopped spinach, thawed </li>
				<li>1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese or feta (or mix) </li>
				<li>1/4 cup minced onion </li>
				<li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
				<li>1 teaspoon chopped dill </li>
				<li>1 teaspoon minced garlic </li>
				<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
				<li>1 large egg </li>
				<li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed, rolled out into a 12" square, kept 
				chilled </li>
			</ul>
			
		</div>
	
		<div class="directions">
			
		<h5>Directions: </h5>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Using your hands, squeeze spinach until dry, forcing out as much water 
				as possible (too much water will make for a soggy filling, you should have 
				about 2/3 well-drained spinach). </li>
				<li>Mix spinach and next 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Season to taste 
				with salt and pepper. </li>
				<li>In a small bowl, beat egg to blend; fold into spinach mixture. </li>
				<li>Cut puff pastry into 3 equal strips. Reserve 1 strip for another use. 
				Cut each remaining strip into 6 squares for a total of 12. Place a square 
				in each mini muffin cup, pressing into bottom and sides and leaving 
				corners pointing up. </li>
				<li>Divide filling among cups. Fold pastry over filing, pressing corners 
				together to meet in center. </li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 400 F. Bake until pastry is golden brown and puffed, 
				about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, let puffs cool in pan for 10 
				minutes. </li>
			</ol>
