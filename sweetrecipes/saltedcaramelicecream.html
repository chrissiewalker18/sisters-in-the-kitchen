		Cooking or cookery is the art of preparing food for consumption with the use of 
		heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting 
		unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The way that 
		cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual 
		cook has. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence 			
		of heat, most notably with Ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish 
		is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice. Sushi also uses a similar 
		chemical reaction between fish and the acidic content of rice glazed with vinegar.
		</p>

		Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans, and some 	
		scientists believe the advent of cooking played an important role in human 
		evolution. Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 
		250,000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade and 
		transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new 
		ingredients.

		<h4>Salted Caramel Ice Cream Recipe: </h4>
		
		<div class="ingredients">
		
		<h5>Ingredients: </h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>1 c. + 2 T sugar, divided </li>
				<li>2 c. heavy cream, room temperature </li>
				<li>3 egg yolks </li>
				<li>1 c. whole milk </li>
				<li>1/2 tsp salt </li>

		<h5>Directions: </h5>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Have ingredients ready and close at hand, once caramel starts to cook, 
				it can cook very quickly and burn easily. Put 2 tablespoon sugar in a 
				heavy bottom pot. Heat over medium high heat. </li>
				<li>Once the sugar has melted and starts to turn golden, stir in an 
				additional 1/2 cup of sugar, two tablespoons at a time. Once sugar is a 
				deep amber color, quickly turn off heat and add cream to pot to stop 
				cooking. Caramel might steam and splatter a bit, so be careful. If any of 
				the caramel crystalizes, heat back up gently and stir until dissolved. 
				</li>
				<li>In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and remaining half cup of 
				sugar until well combined and light yellow. </li>
				<li>Add milk and salt to caramel mixture and heat over medium heat until 
				just barely boiling. </li>
				<li>Slowly whisk about half a cup of milk mixture into the egg yolks to 
				temper the eggs and warm them up. Then add yolks to remainder of the milk 
				and heat over medium heat until mixture thickens and reaches 165 degrees. 
				</li>
				<li>Strain mixture into a bowl and chill in the fridge at least 4 hours or 
				overnight. Once chilled, freeze in ice cream maker according to 
				manufacturer's instructions. </li>
			</ol>
