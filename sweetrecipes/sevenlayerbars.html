		Cooking or cookery is the art of preparing food for consumption with the use of 
		heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting 
		unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The way that 
		cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual 
		cook has. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence 
		of heat, most notably with Ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish 
		is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice. Sushi also uses a similar 
		chemical reaction between fish and the acidic content of rice glazed with vinegar.

		Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans, and some 
		scientists believe the advent of cooking played an important role in human 
		evolution. Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 
		250,000 years ago. The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade and 
		transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new 
		ingredients.
